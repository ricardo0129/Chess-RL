### Movement
- King: One square in any direction
- Rook: Any number of vacant squares along a rank or file
- Bishop: Any number of vacant squares diagonally
- Queen: Any number of vacant squares along a rank, file, or diagonal
- Knight: Moves in an "L" shape, two squares horizontally then one square vertically, or two squares vertically then one square horizontally
- Pawn: Moves forward one square, can move two squares forward from its starting position and captures diagonally one square forward
### Special Moves
- Castling: King moves two squares towards a rook, and the rook moves to the square next to the king. 
Conditions: 
  - Neither piece has moved before
  - No pieces between the king and rook
  - King is not in check, does not pass through check, and does not end up in check
- En passant: A pawn that moves two squares forward can be captured by an opposing pawn that is on an adjacent file, as if it had only moved one square forward.
- Promotion: A pawn that reaches the opponent's back rank can be promoted to any piece (except a king), usually a queen.
